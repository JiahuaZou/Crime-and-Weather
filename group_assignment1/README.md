# Group Assignment 1:

Assignment Requirements

* Write, document, and test code that takes a collection of values at (lat, long) pairs (intended to represent weather stations) and finds the inverse-distance-weighted average value to another given set of (lat, long) points (intended to represent grid points within a county). This is to replicate Ranson's calculation of the daily temperature in a county. The code should so something sensible if any distance is zero.

Prerequisite:

* Please use the stat159.yml in home directory of the github repo to construct your environment

Contents:
* func1.py: This file contains the function that calculate the inverse weighted average distance.
* test_func1.py: This file test functions in func1.py.
* htmlcov: This folder contains test coverage report generated from test_func1.py and coverage rates reach to 100%.
